# portfolio

## Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

Creating a web application from scratch helps me with practicing logical problem solving skills and debugging in regards to code.

This page shows the beginning of a portfolio page to add to as the course progresses.

In the future, I wish to use an updated version of this page to show to future job opportunities.

## Installation

To install the project, I've created a repository on Github and cloned it locally.  Once the coding is finished locally, it was saved and pushed to the repository on Github.
